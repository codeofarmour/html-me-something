                        <h2>Who I am and what I'm talking about</h2>
                        <p>Greetings and Salutations! My name is Terri and I'm getting older, so naturally I've begun to reflect. I left the states
once in my lifetime, and that was for a 3-week excursion to Spain. I walked a portion of the famed Camino de Santiago, past the holy city where the
remains of St. John the Apostle are purported to be interned. I pressed on to Finisterre, the point of land the early Romans believed to be the literal
end of the world. It was a phenomenal experience. Nonetheless, I haven't taken the time to print out my digital pics, so I have decided to create a webby
in honor of my pilgrimage. I had never heard of the Camino until I watched a movie called "The Way". The movie follows a grieving father as he completes
the pilgrimage his adult son Daniel died trying to complete. I liked the movie so much that not only did it inspire my trip to Spain, but this site's
cover page also features a quote from the movie.</p>
                        <p>The beauty of the landscape and the incredible diversity of those walking The Way seemed too good to be true; what's more,
the tradition of pilgrims walking The Way of St. James (Camino de Santiago) dates back nearly 1000 years, and is still going strong today. As a result, many wonderful pilgrim
hostels have appeared all along Camino. The Knights Templar had a tradition of caring for traveling pilgrims, and the spirit of caring seems to have
endured. Hospitality to pilgrims is legendary, and to be honest, quite affordable for those who embrace the experience.</p>
                        <p>The Camino de Santiago is a multi-route pilgrimage to the Galician city, Santiago de Compostela, located in the northernmost
part of Spain. By multi-route, I mean that there are <a href="https://www.caminoadventures.com/camino-routes/" target="_blank">eight known routes
</a>(and undoubtedly several others). Some folks walk from France and spend 3 months doing so. Others may walk from Portugual. It doesn't
matter where you start walking from. In my opinion, your pilgrimage begins the moment you decide you'd like a bit of adventure. There is so
much more to say about the Camino, but why reinvent the wheel? I have provided a nice list of links to help you learn more about the Camino.
In fact, here's one right now, all convenient and in your way: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago" target="_blank">Ta-Daa!</a>.

                            <p>Let me tell you a story. I did all the research. I weighed my backpack, both empty and full; removed items, weighed my backpack again,
and felt pretty good about myself. I had read that even one extra ounce can become a burden if your feet start to blister. I was confident I had prepared. I brought
two quickdry shirts, a light jacket, lightweight convertible pants, 3 pairs of good socks, underwear, a bar of soap, a toothbrush and toothpaste, and a few luxury
items like a hairbrush, a small camera, and an old iphone. Still too much. Everything I brought was basically strapped to my back for 3 weeks. Seriously. Make sure you
need that third pair of pants. There are plenty of stores all along the Camino. You will always be able to find what you need! Please don't follow in my footsteps --
I didn't walk right for weeks (still totally worth it though)!

                                <p>Depending on your preferences, the Camino is wonderful any time of the year. When I was planning my trip,
    I decided to avoid the crowded summer months; believe it or not, but the serene images of empty paths are a rarity when the weather is
    exceptionally nice. I went in September and I had the best walk imaginable. If you're interested in finding out more, this <a href="https://www.caminoadventures.com/what-is-the-best-time-to-walk-the-camino-de-santiago/"
    target="_blank">site</a> does a nice job explaining what to expect at different times throughout the year, including pilgrim traffic
    (which makes a difference when trying to find a bed in a hostel). This site also describes typical weather patterns, which can be quite useful
    when planning what to pack.</p>
                                <p>Speaking of hostels, I highly recommend you at least give them a try. Each camino route includes its own
    delightful list of hostels to stay in. The best part about staying in hostels, aside from being a budget friendly choice (most hostels charge
    anywhere from 3 to 7 euros per night -- some include meals), is how enhanced your camino experience becomes. You truly feel like (and are)
    a pilgrim. You'll need to decide for yourself what your comfort level is, as most hostels feature multiple beds per room and you'll likely
    be surrounded by other pilgrims from all over the world.<br><br> To get a better idea of what hostel life is like, click
