                <p>On a particulary cold and dreary New England afternoon in the winter of 2012, I snuggled up with my warmest blanket
                    and flipped through some channels. I settled on an interesting looking film starring Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez,
                    called, <span>The Way</span>. The movie stars Sheen as a grieving father who has traveled to France to collect the cremains
                    of his recently deceased son, played by Estevez. His adult, free-spirited son had spent his life traveling the world, much to
                    his father's dismay. Sheen's character wants his son to choose a more polished, secure path as a working professional; 
                    in essence, his son Daniel's life is a source of embarrassment and disappointment. 
                    What made this movie so poignant for me was how losing his son brings him closer to fully understanding, and ultimately appreciating, the
                    beauty of who his son had been.</p>         
                <p>Once Sheen's character, Tom, arrives in France, he is moved by his loss to honor his son's memory by finishing the trek across Spain 
                    that his son had died trying to complete.</p>

                <p>As soon as the movie ended, I knew I wanted to make the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela too. I started doing a ton of research and
                    it wasn't long before I had collected a nice list of websites to help me plan my trip (I've also included some more recent ones):</p>

                <p>If you are interested in walking the camino, or The Way, then I highly recommend you plan before you go. Referencing the above sites is an excellent
                        place to start. You will also want to do some physical preparation, which some of these sites (and many available via online search) can explain
                        in greater detail.</p>

        <h2>My Camino</h2>
        <p>After intense preparation, I headed to Spain 8 months after first watching The Way! I flew to Madrid, found my way to the right bus, and
        somehow managed to make it to my starting point without getting lost. I began my camino in Astorga, and ultimately walked 217 miles to Fisterre, which the
        early Romans believed to be the end of the world. I actually walked along the remarkably well-preserved remains of ancient Roman roads, through the clouds,
        and deftly avoided cowpies along the way. It was an amazing adventure and I cannot wait to do it again.</p>

        delightful list of hostels to stay in. The best part about staying in hostels, aside from being a 
    budget friendly choice (most hostels charge anywher3 from 3 to 7 euros per night -- some include meals),
is how enhanced your camino experience becomes. You truly feel (and are) a pilgrim. You'll need to decide
for yourself what your comfort level is, as most hostels feature multiple beds per room and you'll likely
be surrounded by other pilgrims from all over the world.<br><br> To get a better idea of what hostel life is
